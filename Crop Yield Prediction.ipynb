    "Crop yield prediction is an essential predictive analytics technique in the agriculture industry. It is an agricultural practice that can help farmers and farming businesses predict crop yield in a particular season when to plant a crop, and when to harvest for better crop yield. Predictive analytics is a powerful tool that can help to improve decision-making in the agriculture industry. It can be used for crop yield prediction, risk mitigation, reducing the cost of fertilizers, etc. The crop yield prediction using ML and flask deployment will find analysis on weather conditions, soil quality, fruit set, fruit mass, etc."
